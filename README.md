# FireLeetcode
My curated list of Data/Structure & Algorithm problems

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/hawaijar/FireLeetcode.svg?branch=feature%2Falgoexpert)](https://app.travis-ci.com/hawaijar/FireLeetcode)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/hawaijar/FireLeetcode/badge.svg?branch=feature/algoexpert)](https://coveralls.io/github/hawaijar/FireLeetcode?branch=feature/algoexpert)

This repo (wip) (will)contains many popular algorithms (based on common data structures and algorithms) written in JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin and **C++**. There's also a (less)organised repo (master) if you want to refer problems randomly.

It is structured based on data structure names (Arrays, Strings, Trees etc.)
And under each category will have curated (popular) list of problems and solutions as well. Attempts have been made to find multiple solutions (against each problem) to compare/contrast complexity(between/among them) as well.

Also, there is a unit testing folder (__test__) to include some sample test cases.

_A small disclaimer_: This project is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes only, and it is not meant to be used for production.

_Note_: Currently, the test coverage reflects only JS code. Test coverage for Swift/Kotlin/C++ is currently not in the plan.
