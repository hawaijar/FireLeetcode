### Binary Search Tree
Write a Binary Search Tree that supports the following operations -

`insert(value) - insert a value`

`contains(value) - search a value `

`remove(value) - remove a value`


#### One key point to be noted:

- For the remove(), consider the case where the node to be deleted is a **root node,** and it's the **only node** in the tree.
