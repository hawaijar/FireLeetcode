[Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

 

Example 1:

```
Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
