### 172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes
[Leedcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/)

Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Follow up: Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?

 

#### Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.

#### Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.

#### Example 3:

Input: n = 0
Output: 0



## This is a simple mathematical problem (and there's a formula as well) and we don't even need to find/calculate factorial at the first place!
